## Introduction
A dynamic array is a versatile data structure that can grow in size as needed. This project will walk you through the process of creating your own dynamic integer array in C# step by step. By the end, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how dynamic arrays work and how to implement them in your own projects.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-int-array-csharp.git

   
2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).

3. Explore the code files in the repository to understand the initial implementation.

4. Start with the initial code and proceed to implement each step described below.

## Implementation Steps
The dynamic integer array implementation is divided into several steps. You can track each step by checking the commit tags in the repository. Here are the  functionality tasklist:

### Task List for Implementing a Dynamic Integer Array

- [x] Task 1: Implement a Dynamic Integer Array

**Description:** In this initial step, you'll create a dynamic integer array with two simple functionalities: adding values and removing values. The values you add or remove will be constant for this step, so you won't need to worry about resizing the array just yet.

- [x] Task 2: Implement getSize and getCapacity Functions

**Description:** Now, let's add functionality to get the current size and capacity of your dynamic array. These functions should provide insights into how the array is managing its data.

- [x] Task 3: Write Tests for Task 1 and 2

**Description:** It's important to ensure the correctness of your dynamic array's basic functionalities. Write unit tests that thoroughly check the add, remove, getSize, and getCapacity functions.

- [ ] Task 4: Implement removeByIndex Function

**Description:** Extend your dynamic array by implementing a function that can remove a value at a specific index in the array. Make sure to handle resizing if necessary.

- [ ] Task 5: Implement removeAll Function

**Description:** Create a function that removes all elements from the dynamic array. This operation should also consider resizing the array to free up memory.

- [ ] Task 6: Implement clear Function

**Description:** The clear function should be designed to empty the array without deallocating its memory. It should set the size to zero but keep the capacity intact.

- [ ] Task 7: Implement insertAtIndex Function

**Description:** Extend your dynamic array to allow inserting a value at a specific index. Be sure to handle resizing and shifting elements as needed.

- [ ] Task 8: Implement modifyAtIndex Function

**Description:** Create a function that allows modifying a value at a specific index in the dynamic array. This should help learners understand how to access and modify elements.

- [ ] Task 9: Additional Functionality

**Description:** Add any additional functionality that you think would be valuable for learners. For example, you could implement a search function, sorting algorithms, or any other operations commonly associated with dynamic arrays.

- [ ] Task 10: Performance Optimization

**Description:** Challenge learners to optimize the dynamic array's performance. This could involve implementing more efficient resizing strategies or enhancing specific functions.
